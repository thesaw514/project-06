### `Description`

Welcome to Project 06 of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree program. In this project, the primary goal for students is to create a dynamic bookshelf app that allows users to select and categorize books based on what they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using the React JavaScript library to buildout the application, and provides an API server and client library that they will use to make all book related information persist as they interact with the application.

### `Installation`

To run the project:
* Download + install Node.js.
* Clone (or download) the .zip project files folder to your local desktop.
* Open terminal app and navigate to project folder.
* Type: `npm install` to install the required project dependencies.
* Type: `npm start` to start the development server, which will then open a browser window running the app located at `http://localhost:3000/` upon successful startup.

### `Instructions`

Books are sorted into three categories:
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

To change a book's category or remove a book from the list, click on the round green button located on the lower-right corner of the book's cover.

To add new books, click the round green `+` button located at the bottom-right of the MyReads app homepage.
